# Codsoft_Java-Programming-ATM-Interface
Task 3:- ATM Interface
This Java program implements a simple **ATM Interface** that allows users to manage a bank account through options like depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking the current balance. The program consists of two main classes: `BankAccount`, which handles account operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry, and `ATM`, which provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface to interact with the bank account. The `ATMInterface` class serves as the entry point, initializing a bank account with a default balance and linking it to the ATM. The program incorporates input validation, ensuring secure and reliable transactions, making it an excellent demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts in Java.
